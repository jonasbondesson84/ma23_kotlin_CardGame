# ma23_kotlin_CardGame

This is a game where you face many different challenges. You need to get enough points on every challange to get to the next level.
You'll see your progress on a progress tree.
There will be different kind of card games challenges, not just one. 
All should be done with a cute interface and easy-to-understand rules. 
If there is time, I'll try to implement animations for every character
